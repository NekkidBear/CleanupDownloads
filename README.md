# CleanupDownloads

This is a quick and dirty script I used to clean up my downloads folder because I had downloaded a lot of 3d meshes and animations. This will compare the user's downloads folder with a backup destination directory, and then it will prompt to delete the file in Downloads if it has been backed up.

Future plans are to create a directory selection prompt, and to add the copy ability to add additional files that aren't backed up, but should be.

***WARNING***
This script can and will delete items when given the permission to do so. These files may or may not be recoverable. Please delete responsibly at your own risk.
